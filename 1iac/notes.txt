IAC: Infrastructure As Code
Provisioning infrastructure through software(code) to achieveve consistent and predictable environments.

Declarative Vs Imperative:
Declarative is to define the end result and the system performs the task. (what)
Imperative is to define steps on how to get the end result and the system follows the steps.(what and how)

Idempotent And Consistent:
Idempotent is to do a task repeatedly and the result should be the same (consistent) if no changes. (state)

Push Or Pull:
Push is when you give the code to perform a task. (Terraform)
Pull is when code is taken to perform a task. (generally an agent)

IAC Benefits:
- Reusability (DRY)
- Automated Deployment
- Repeatable
- Consistent environments
- Documented Architecture
