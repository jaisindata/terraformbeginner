Terraform:
Infrastructure automation tool.
The Terraform language is declarative, describing an intended goal rather than 
the steps to reach that goal.
Terraform only considers implicit and explicit relationships between resources 
when determining an order of operations.

Core components:
- Executable
- Configuration Files
- Provider Plugins (registry.terraform.io)
- State Data

Terraform Object Types:
Providers
Resources
Data Sources

Block syntax:
block_type label name_label {
  key = value
  nested_block {
    key = value
  }
}

Terraform Object Reference:
<resource_type>.<name_label>.<attribute>
<resource_type>.<name_label>
